# lil-humans
Watch your lil humans grow! This is an open-source simulation project. 

##Values
-emphasis on modularity (make it easy to revamp systems in the future)
-emphasis on first-principles. we want to encode as little bias into the simulation as possible (ofc simplifying assumptions will have to be made), but also be fascinated with the emergent behaviors that pop up. It should be entertaining to watch our lil humans interact and figure things out for themselves.
